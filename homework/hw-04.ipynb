A project at George Mason University digitized her diary and put it online. I've done some research using the entries, and am supplying you with two years' worth of Ballard's entries (1804 and 1805). Each of her entries for these two years are contained in a separate text file that I've already preprocessed, cleaned up, and put into all lowercase for you.\n",

We're going to remove this material so the texts contain (mostly) just the narratives themselves. To do so, we need to figure out where the narratives actually begin inside the text file. In Truth's case, it starts on [this page](https://archive.org/details/narrativeofsojou1850gilb/page/n11/mode/2up) with the words \"The subject of this biography\". Brown's begins on [this page](https://archive.org/details/narrativeofhenry00brow/page/n11/mode/2up) with the words \"\"I AM not about to harrow the feelings of my readers\".
